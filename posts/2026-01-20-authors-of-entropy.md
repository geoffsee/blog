## Summary

There are two ways to talk about the future. Either it’s a finished thing we simply can’t see yet, or it’s genuinely unfinished—missing pieces that do not exist until they’re made real.

This post is a set of hypotheses (not proofs) about what the world would have to look like if that second view were correct. If free will is more than randomness, it should show up as a detectable break in the kinds of models that assume “state + laws → next state.” And if those breaks exist, we may need a different scientific posture: not perfect prediction, but careful witnessing of decision boundaries.

## Hidden vs Unwritten

Determinism makes a strong claim: given the complete physical state of the universe and the laws of physics, the future is already fixed. Our uncertainty is epistemic—about what we know—not ontological—about what exists.

The alternative is stranger:

> The future is not merely unknown. Parts of it are uncreated.

If that’s true, “entropy” isn’t just a measure of disorder. It’s a measure of missing information, and agency is one of the processes by which missing information becomes real information—by selecting among possibilities and collapsing “could be” into “is.”

## Eight Claims (A Research Program)

These are deliberately stated in a way that invites attack. If even one is true, strict traversal determinism (the idea that the universe is simply running a fixed script) is in trouble.

1. **Genuine novelty exists.** There are actions whose outcomes cannot be derived—even in principle—from prior physical state plus laws. If novelty is real, the future is incomplete, not merely hidden.

2. **Choice events are structurally detectable.** Decision points should leave signatures: non-Markovian jumps, abrupt regime changes, or persistent residuals that remain even when you give a predictor “all the history.” If choice is real, it is not just noise.

3. **Consciousness is a causal primitive.** Conscious systems should exhibit causal asymmetries absent in non-conscious systems of similar complexity. If consciousness never changes outcomes, it is hard to distinguish from a story we tell after the fact.

4. **The future is locally incomplete.** Not every future event admits a coherent probability assignment. Some outcomes are undefined rather than merely unlikely—unknown versus uncreated.

5. **Determinism fails at semantic boundaries.** Physical evolution may remain lawful, but semantic transitions—moments where meaning is introduced—do not follow from physics alone. Meaning becomes a causal force, not just a narrative overlay.

6. **Prediction engines are categorically limited.** Perfect prediction of a free choice is self-negating: if an agent can condition on the prediction, the prediction can become part of what the agent is choosing against. This is not a performance limit; it’s a boundary created by self-reference.

7. **Witnessing is a valid scientific role.** Some systems should be built to observe divergence rather than to forecast outcomes. Frameworks that focus on mapping decision boundaries may outperform those that only optimize predictive accuracy.

8. **Determinism and free will are empirically distinguishable.** These are not just philosophical preferences; they imply different observable world structures. If any of the above claims hold, the “everything was always going to happen” picture is incomplete.

## Prediction Has a Limit

Most of science is built on compression: find the shortest description that predicts the most. That works astonishingly well—until you hit systems where the act of prediction changes the predicted.

If an agent can read a forecast and choose to violate it, the forecast becomes a kind of constraint, not a passive observation. You can still predict statistically (people are predictable in bulk), but “perfect prediction of the next choice” starts to look like an incoherent target—like asking for a map that includes itself at full resolution.

If free will exists, the boundary won’t show up as “models are bad,” but as something more specific: a hard floor on predictability at decision points that doesn’t vanish with more data, more compute, or more expressive architectures.

## The Witness System

If prediction is the wrong instrument at the boundary, what replaces it?

A witness system doesn’t try to guess the outcome. It tries to identify *where* outcomes become undecidable-from-the-past, and to measure what changes across that boundary: the distribution of futures before the decision, and the realized fact after it.

In other words: treat choice the way we treat phase transitions. Don’t argue about whether “water is really different from steam.” Measure the boundary conditions and the qualitative change in behavior across the threshold.

## Honest Assessment

- **This is speculative.** Several claims (especially about consciousness) are not mainstream and may be wrong.
- **“In principle” is doing work.** We can rarely distinguish “irreducible” from “currently unmodeled,” so the burden is to propose signatures that survive better models.
- **Noise and choice are easy to confuse.** A good test would need to separate randomness, hidden variables, and genuine agency—not just declare victory at unexplained residuals.

But a weakness is also a guide: it points toward what a real research program would have to operationalize.

## The Real Question

If the future is partly unwritten, then prediction is not the only relationship we can have with it.

The deeper question is whether we want to build systems—human, institutional, or artificial—that treat agency as a rounding error in a giant forecast… or systems that recognize decision boundaries as the places where the world is actively being authored.

**In Conclusion**, “Authors of Entropy” is not a claim that free will has been proven. It’s a claim about legibility: if free will is real, it should be visible in the structure of the world, not only in our introspection. And if it’s visible, then the scientific job isn’t merely to predict the future—it’s also to witness where it comes into existence.
