# AI Executive Order: What Developers Need to Know

On December 11, 2025, the President signed an executive order establishing a "national policy framework" for AI regulation. The order's goal is to create "one rulebook" for AI development, preempting the patchwork of state-level AI laws that have been emerging across the country.

For AI developers and startups, this has significant implications. Let's break down what it actually means.

## What the Executive Order Does

The order takes several concrete actions:

**1. Creates a DOJ AI Litigation Task Force**

The Department of Justice must establish a task force within 30 days to challenge state AI laws. The legal argument: AI is interstate commerce and should be regulated at the federal level.

**2. Identifies "Onerous" State Laws**

The Commerce Department has 90 days to compile a list of state AI laws deemed burdensome. States with laws on this list could face consequences for federal funding, including broadband grants under the BEAD program.

**3. Directs FTC and FCC Action**

Both agencies are instructed to work with the DOJ to circumvent state regulations that the administration considers obstacles to AI development.

**4. Calls for Congressional Action**

The order explicitly calls for Congress to craft a national AI legislative framework that would formally preempt state AI laws.

## What It Doesn't Do

Here's the critical gap: **the order doesn't create a federal regulatory framework**. It attacks existing state rules without replacing them with federal standards. That would require Congressional action, which hasn't happened despite various proposals.

David Sacks, the administration's AI czar, emphasized that the order "does not mean the Administration will challenge every State AI law." Notably, child safety regulations around AI are explicitly exempted.

## The State Response

States aren't backing down. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis posted that "An executive order doesn't/can't preempt state legislative action" and that only Congress can do that. California State Senator Scott Wiener, author of state AI bill SB 53, called the order "absurd" and questioned whether the DOJ can "weaponize" federal power against state rights.

This sets up a potentially lengthy legal battle that could take years to resolve.

## What This Means for AI Developers

### The Good News

- **Potential compliance simplification**: Over 1,000 state AI bills have been proposed. A single federal standard would reduce the burden of navigating conflicting requirements across states.
- **Clearer deployment path**: One set of rules would make it easier to deploy AI products nationally without state-by-state analysis.
- **Industry-friendly direction**: The order is viewed as favorable to AI companies, particularly those who have lobbied for federal preemption.

### The Bad News

**Legal limbo is the new reality.** State laws remain enforceable while legal challenges play out. You'll need to:

1. **Keep complying with existing state laws** until courts rule otherwise
2. **Monitor legal developments** across multiple jurisdictions
3. **Build flexibility into compliance systems** to adapt as the landscape shifts

**Small startups bear the biggest burden.** As Andrew Gamino-Cheong, CTO of Trustible, noted: "Big Tech and the big AI startups have the funds to hire lawyers... The uncertainty does hurt startups the most."

Large companies can absorb legal costs and wait out uncertainty. If you're a small startup, you may not have that luxury.

**Risk-sensitive customers will hesitate.** Healthcare, finance, and legal sector customers demand regulatory clarity. Uncertainty extends sales cycles and increases the friction of AI adoption.

## Practical Guidance for AI Developers

### 1. Don't Abandon State Compliance Yet

The executive order doesn't make state laws disappear. Until court rulings or Congressional action changes things, California's AI transparency requirements, Colorado's AI bias laws, and similar state regulations still apply.

### 2. Document Your Compliance Approach

Whatever approach you take now, document it thoroughly. If regulations change, you'll need to demonstrate good-faith compliance during the transition period.

### 3. Watch Key States

California, Colorado, Illinois, and New York have the most developed AI regulatory frameworks. What happens in legal challenges to their laws will likely set precedents.

### 4. Build for Flexibility

Design your AI systems with compliance hooks that can adapt to regulatory changes. Feature flags for disclosure requirements, modular audit logging, and configurable content policies will be valuable regardless of how federal-state jurisdiction shakes out.

### 5. Engage with the Process

The Commerce Department's 90-day review is an opportunity for input. If specific state requirements are particularly burdensome for your use case, now is the time to document and communicate that.

## The Bigger Picture

This executive order represents a significant shift in the AI regulatory landscape, but it's not the final word. The tension between federal preemption and state authority will play out in courts and Congress over the coming years.

For AI developers, the takeaway is this: regulatory uncertainty isn't going away soon. Build your companies and products to be resilient to change, maintain compliance with current requirements, and stay engaged with how this evolves.

The one rulebook promise sounds appealing, but we may be navigating multiple rulebooks for some time yet.
